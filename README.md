draw management
Its a test for draw management 

How It Works
The system determines the appropriate draw generation method based on the sport:

Tournament Draw (for racquet sports and cricket):

Randomly shuffles participants
Pairs them sequentially
Assigns "Bye" to the last participant if there's an odd number


Golf Draw:

Randomly shuffles participants
Creates groups of 4 players each
Handles remaining players in smaller groups if needed



Future Improvements

Add seeding functionality for ranked players
Implement round-robin tournament formats
Support for elimination brackets (single/double)
Add scheduling capabilities
Implement score tracking and tournament progression
